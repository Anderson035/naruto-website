                <p>Naruto grew up as an orphan in the Hidden Leaf Village, striving to gain acknowledgment from others despite the Nine-Tails sealed within him.</p>
                <p>Growing up as an orphan who suffered years of hatred and social 
                isolation has influenced Naruto's character in a number of ways: 
                he is heedless to formality and social standings, 
                addressing certain people with nicknames instead of honourifics,
                although by the time of his adulthood, Naruto has slightly outgrown this trait.
             	He has picky eating habits of ramen, his favourite food; he has a perverted side 
             	that manifests as attempts to peep into women's baths, although these moments are rare.
             	Despite his quirks and the criticism they earn him to the point of being labelled the 
             	ultimate problem child, Naruto is said to have a personality that draws people to him,
             	inspiring friendship and loyalty through acts of genuine kindness that 
             	could change a person's world view and thus built meaningful relationships 
             	that he lacked in early life; the Sage of Six Paths believes Naruto's kindness
             	is a special gift that allows him to save Kurama from its hatred.
             	Naruto deeply cherishes these bonds and will go to great lengths to protect them, 
             	best seen with Sasuke after his defection from Konoha.<p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>On the day of her enrolment in the Ninja Academy - Naruto first met Hinata HyÅ«ga,
                who was being picked on by three bullies. Despite not knowing her, 
                Naruto immediately came to her defence, but he was outnumbered and knocked unconscious,
                and the bullies damaged his red scarf. When Naruto awoke, Hinata thanked him for helping her 
                and returned his scarf to him, but he let her keep it. 
                He was unaware that the girl's growing affection for him began at that moment.<p>

				<p>In the Academy, Naruto became a student of Iruka Umino, 
				who acted as a surrogate older brother to keep him in line and help him work harder.
				Naruto also met his classmate Sasuke Uchiha and tried to befriend him,
				since Sasuke was alone as well. Jealous of Sasuke's skills and popularity,
				however,[22] he developed a one-sided rivalry in his pursuit to prove himself
				just as good as, if not better than, Sasuke, wishing that someday, 
				Sasuke would accept him as an equal. Naruto also grew close with the owner 
				of Ramen Ichiraku, Teuchi and his daughter Ayame, being welcomed as their 
				favourite customer.<p>
                <p>Naruto formed bonds with Iruka, Sasuke, and Sakura, and started his journey as a ninja under Team 7, led by Kakashi Hatake.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>"Naruto: Shippuden" is the sequel to the original "Naruto" anime and 
                follows the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition 
                and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village, Konohagakure.
                Set two and a half years after the events of the original series, "Shippuden"
            	focuses on Naruto's growth as a ninja and his quest to rescue 
                his friend Sasuke Uchiha, who has left the village to gain power 
                from the rogue ninja Orochimaru.<p>

				<p>The series delves deeper into the characters' backstories, explores 
				themes of friendship, perseverance, and redemption, and introduces new 
				characters and powerful enemies, particularly the Akatsuki organization, 
				which seeks to capture the Tailed Beasts, including Naruto's inner demon,
				the Nine-Tails.<p>

				<p>As the story progresses, Naruto and his friends face numerous challenges,
				 including battles against formidable foes and the overarching threat of 
				 the Fourth Great Ninja War. The series combines action, emotional storytelling,
				 and character development, making it a beloved entry in the shonen anime genre.</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>After years of perseverance and battles, Naruto finally fulfilled his 
                dream of becoming Hokage and established peace in the ninja world.</p>
                
                <p>Naruto's ambition to become the Hokage reflected his mysterious parentage,
                as well as his desire for attention and approval from a village that hated him.
                It might also speak to Sarutobi. and how he failed to truly help the boy.<p>
